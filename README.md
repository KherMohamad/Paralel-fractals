# Paralel-fractals
The program generates fractals for the Mandelbrot and Julia sets for complex polynomial functions.
Because such a task requires high amounts of calculation I decided to optimize it by using Pthreads to make a multithreaded program.
The skel folder contains a single-thread solution while the sol flder contains my multithreaded solution
